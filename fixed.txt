🔹 Big Picture Summary
Capital budgeting is the process firms use to evaluate long-term investment projects (like buying equipment, opening a location, etc.). These decisions are critical because they involve large amounts of money and impact the firm’s future value.
The core idea:







1️⃣ Types of Projects






Normal Cash Flow
One sign change
Initial outflow → positive inflows
Nonnormal Cash Flow
Multiple sign changes
Can create multiple IRRs
3️⃣ Net Present Value (NPV)
NPV=∑CFt(1+r)t
(1+r)
CF
	​
	​
Decision Rule:
If NPV > 0 → Accept
If NPV < 0 → Reject
Why NPV is Best:
Directly measures value added
Assumes reinvestment at WACC (realistic)
Works correctly for mutually exclusive projects
4️⃣ Internal Rate of Return (IRR)


NPV=0







Why It Exists:
Fixes IRR reinvestment assumption
Avoids multiple IRR problem
Assumption:
Cash inflows reinvested at WACC
Decision Rule:
If MIRR > WACC → Accept
MIRR is better than IRR but still secondary to NPV.
6️⃣ NPV vs IRR Conflicts







Definition:
Time required to recover initial investment.
Strengths:
Easy
Measures liquidity & risk
Weaknesses:
Ignores time value of money
Ignores cash flows after payback
No value maximization logic
8️⃣ Discounted Payback
Same idea as payback, but uses discounted cash flows.
Still inferior to NPV.
9️⃣ Unequal Life Projects
When projects have different lifespans:
Two Methods:
Replacement Chain
Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA)
EAA converts NPV into annual payment equivalent.
🔟 Key Concepts to Remember for Exams
Goal: Maximize shareholder wealth
Primary method: NPV
IRR is intuitive but flawed
MIRR fixes IRR issues
Payback = risk measure, not value measure
NPV > 0 = value creation
🧠 How This All Connects
Capital budgeting answers:
“Will this project increase firm value?”
NPV measures value directly.
Payback measures liquidity.
