# figgie-insights
This started off as a quantitative research project on my own time, trying to model the common suit and best strategies, but I might as well flesh it out into a simulation.

Figgie is a great game about market making and decisions under uncertainty, and there is a lot to be learned by playing. I think there's also a lot to be learned by winning, which is what I set out to do in this project.

There are a few different strategies besides finding the goal suit; Providing liquidity, working the spread, hoarding, selling - all valid strategies, but some may be better than others.
